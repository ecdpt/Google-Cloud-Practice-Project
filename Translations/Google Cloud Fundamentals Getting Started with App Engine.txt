2. Select the region where you want your App Engine application located.
3. Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
	git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples
4. Navigate to the source directory:
	cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

Task 2: Run Hello World application locally
Steps:
1. At the Cloud Shell command prompt. Execute the following command to download and update the packages list:
	sudo apt-get update
2. Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application with this command:
	sudo apt-get install virtualenv
3. If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.
4. Install the virtual enviroment:
	virtualenv -p python3 venv
5. Activate the virtual environment:

	pip install  -r requirements.txt
7. Run the application:
	python main.py
8. Preview the application on port 8080 
9. Press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service and return to cloud shell
Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
Steps:
1. Navigate to the source directory:
