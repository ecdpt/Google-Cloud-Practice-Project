Lab:  Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
Objectives: 
1. In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
2. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
3. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
4. Connect between the two instances.
Task 1:  Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console
steps:
1. Open incognito window
2. Click Start Lab button
3. Observe the log in credentials
4. Click Open Google console
5. Enter the log in credential as prompted
Task 2: Create a virtual machine using the GCP Console
steps:
1. Gather the parameters:
a. Name: my-vm-1
b. zone uscentral1-1a
c. Machine type: ni-standard-1
d. boot disk: Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)
2.  Enter the following command at gcloud:
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-1" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"
Task 3: Create a second virtual machine
steps:
1. display a list of all the zones in the region to which Qwiklabs assigned you:
gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1
2. Choose a zone from that list other than the zone to which Qwiklabs assigned you - us-central1-b
3. Set your default zone to the one you just chose:
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
5 Create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in the zone:
gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" \
--machine-type "n1-standard-1" \
--image-project "debian-cloud" \
--image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
--subnet "default"
Task 4: Connect between VM instances
steps:
1. Confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
	ping my-vm-1
2. Press Ctrl+C to abort the ping command.
3. Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:
	ssh my-vm-1
4. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
	sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
5. Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server
	sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
6. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like the following text:
	Hi from Charles
7. Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.
8. Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
	curl http://localhost/ 
9. To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
	exit
10. To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, execute this command:
	curl http://my-vm-1/
